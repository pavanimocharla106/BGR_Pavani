# Bandgap Reference Design

This repository documents the complete design, analysis, simulation, and implementation of a Bandgap Reference (BGR) Circuit using the SkyWater SKY130 PDK

## Objective
To design a stable voltage reference independent of temperature and process variations.
# *INTRODUCTION*
A **Bandgap Reference (BGR)** circuit is an essential building block in analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits.  
Its main function is to generate a **stable reference voltage** that remains **independent of temperature, supply voltage, and process variations**.  
This stable voltage is used in many critical applications such as **ADCs, DACs, voltage regulators, and biasing circuits**.

The concept of the Bandgap Reference is based on combining two temperature-dependent voltages:

1. **CTAT (Complementary to Absolute Temperature) Voltage:**  
   - Typically derived from the **base-emitter voltage (V<sub>BE</sub>)** of a bipolar transistor.  
   - V<sub>BE</sub> decreases with increasing temperature (negative temperature coefficient).

2. **PTAT (Proportional to Absolute Temperature) Voltage:**  
   - Generated from the **difference in base-emitter voltages (ΔV<sub>BE</sub>)** between two transistors operating at different current densities.  
   - ΔV<sub>BE</sub> increases with temperature (positive temperature coefficient).

By carefully scaling and summing these two voltages, the opposing temperature effects cancel out, resulting in a **constant output voltage**—typically around **1.2 V**, which corresponds to the bandgap voltage of silicon at 0 K.

---

### ⚙️ Key Features
- Provides a **temperature-stable voltage reference** (~1.2 V)
- **Insensitive** to power supply and process variations
- Can be implemented using **bipolar or CMOS processes**
- Widely used in **precision analog and mixed-signal ICs**



### 🧠 Working Principle (Simplified)
At its core, the Bandgap Reference circuit works as follows:
1. Generate a CTAT voltage from a diode-connected BJT (V<sub>BE</sub>).
2. Generate a PTAT voltage using two BJTs with different emitter area ratios.
3. Add the PTAT voltage (positive TC) to the CTAT voltage (negative TC) in proper proportions.
4. The resulting sum is a **temperature-independent reference voltage**.

## 1. Tool and PDK Setup
### 1.1 Tools Setup

For the design, simulation, and verification of the Bandgap Reference (BGR) circuit, the following open-source EDA tools are used:

---

#### 🧪 Ngspice — Circuit Simulation
**Ngspice** is an open-source SPICE-based simulator used for performing **analog circuit simulations**.  
<img width="289" height="123"  src="https://github.com/pavanimocharla106/BGR_Pavani/blob/main/images/1.jpeg" />
It takes a **SPICE netlist** as input, which describes the circuit components and their connections, and then computes electrical parameters such as node voltages, currents, and transfer characteristics.  
In this project, Ngspice is used to:
- Simulate the **schematic-level design** of the BGR circuit.  
- Analyze **DC**, **AC**, and **transient** behavior.  
- Verify **temperature dependence** and output voltage stability.

-Steps to install Ngspice - Open the terminal and type the following to install Ngspice
```bash
$  sudo apt-get install ngspice
```

#### 🧩 Magic — Layout Design and DRC
**Magic** is a VLSI layout editor developed by Berkeley, primarily used for **IC layout design** in open-source PDKs such as **Sky130**.  
It provides interactive tools for drawing transistors, interconnects, and layers according to process design rules.  
Magic is used here to:
- Create the **physical layout** of the BGR circuit.  
- Perform **Design Rule Check (DRC)** to ensure the layout complies with the fabrication constraints of the Sky130 process.  
- Extract the layout to generate a **SPICE netlist** for post-layout simulations.

#### 🔗 Netgen — LVS (Layout vs. Schematic)
**Netgen** is a layout verification tool used for **Layout Versus Schematic (LVS)** comparison.  
It compares the netlist extracted from the layout (using Magic) with the schematic netlist (used in Ngspice simulation) to verify connectivity and device matching.  
A successful LVS ensures that the **layout accurately represents the schematic**, confirming the design’s electrical integrity before fabrication.

## 2. BGR Introduction

### 2.1 BGR Principle

The **Bandgap Reference (BGR)** circuit generates a temperature-independent reference voltage by combining two voltage components with **opposite temperature coefficients**.

The basic operation principle of a BGR circuit is to **sum a voltage with a negative temperature coefficient (CTAT)** and another with a **positive temperature coefficient (PTAT)** such that their variations cancel each other.

<img width="937" height="571"  src="https://github.com/pavanimocharla106/BGR_Pavani/blob/main/images/3.jpeg" />

---

#### 🧩 Key Concepts

- **CTAT (Complementary to Absolute Temperature):**  
  A voltage that **decreases** as temperature **increases**.  
  Typically, the **base-emitter voltage (V<sub>BE</sub>)** of a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) or a diode exhibits CTAT behavior.
  

- **PTAT (Proportional to Absolute Temperature):**  
  A voltage that **increases** as temperature **increases**.  
  This can be generated using the **difference between two V<sub>BE</sub>** voltages of transistors operating at different current densities.

---

#### ⚙️ Principle of Operation

The BGR circuit operates by **adding** the CTAT and PTAT voltages in proper proportion so that the resulting voltage remains constant over temperature.
####  2.1.1 CTAT VOLTAGE GENERATION
Semiconductor diodes typically exhibit CTAT (Complementary to Absolute Temperature) behavior. When a constant current flows through a forward-biased diode, an increase in temperature causes the voltage across the diode to decrease. Experimentally, the rate of decrease of the diode’s forward voltage with temperature is approximately –2 mV/°C.
<img width="825" height="295"  src="https://github.com/pavanimocharla106/BGR_Pavani/blob/main/images/4.jpeg" />

####  2.1.2 PTAT VOLTAGE GENERATION
<img width="328" height="627"  src="https://github.com/pavanimocharla106/BGR_Pavani/blob/main/images/8.jpeg" />

From the diode current equation, it can be observed that the diode voltage consists of two main temperature-dependent components:

Thermal voltage (Vₜ) — This term is directly proportional to temperature (approximately of order ~1).

Reverse saturation current (Iₛ) — This term increases with temperature approximately with an order of ~2.5.

Since Iₛ appears in the denominator of the logarithmic term (ln(I₀/Iₛ)), an increase in temperature causes this term to decrease, resulting in the CTAT behavior of the diode voltage.

Therefore, to design a PTAT (Proportional to Absolute Temperature) voltage generation circuit, we need a method to isolate the Vₜ component from the Iₛ dependence.

The following approach describes how this separation can be achieved.

<img width="452" height="412"  src="https://github.com/pavanimocharla106/BGR_Pavani/blob/main/images/6.jpeg" />

In the above circuit same amount of current I is flowing in both the branches. So the node voltage A and B are going to be same V. Now in the B branch if we substract V1 from V, we get Vt independent of Is.

<img width="640" height="383"  src="https://github.com/pavanimocharla106/BGR_Pavani/blob/main/images/7.jpeg" />

V= Combined Voltage across R1 and Q2 (CTAT in nature but less sloppy)
V1= Voltage across Q2 (CTAT in nature but more sloppy)
V-V1= Voltage across R1 (PTAT in nature)

From the above analysis, it is evident that the voltage difference (V – V₁) exhibits a PTAT (Proportional to Absolute Temperature) behavior. However, its slope is relatively small compared to the CTAT (Complementary to Absolute Temperature) characteristic of a diode.

To enhance the PTAT slope, multiple BJTs configured as diodes can be used in parallel. This reduces the current flowing through each individual diode, which in turn increases the slope of the (V – V₁) characteristic, thereby improving the PTAT response.
<img width="1002" height="507"  src="https://github.com/pavanimocharla106/BGR_Pavani/blob/main/images/9.jpeg" />



#### 🧠 Summary

- **Diode / BJT junction** provides the **CTAT** component.  
- **Difference in V<sub>BE</sub>** between transistors provides the **PTAT** component.  
- When both are combined properly, the **temperature variations cancel**, producing a **constant reference voltage (~1.2 V)** close to the **bandgap voltage of silicon**.

---

📘 *In simple terms, the BGR circuit uses one voltage that decreases with temperature and another that increases with temperature — when added in the right ratio, the overall result stays constant.*

### 2.2 Types of Bandgap Reference (BGR)

The **Bandgap Reference (BGR)** circuit can be classified in different ways depending on its **circuit architecture** and **application requirements**.

---

#### 🧩 Architecture-wise Classification

Based on the circuit implementation approach, BGR circuits are commonly designed using:

1. **Self-Biased Current Mirror Architecture**  
   - Uses transistor-level biasing without external amplifiers.  
   - Offers simplicity and good stability.  
   - Suitable for integration in analog and mixed-signal ICs.

2. **Operational Amplifier-Based Architecture**  
   - Uses an op-amp to control node voltages precisely.  
   - Provides better accuracy and matching.  
   - Often used in precision reference applications.

---

#### ⚙️ Application-wise Classification

Depending on design goals and target specifications, BGR circuits can be categorized as:

1. **Low-Voltage BGR** — Optimized to operate at reduced supply voltages.  
2. **Low-Power BGR** — Designed for minimal power consumption, suitable for battery-powered systems.  
3. **High-PSRR and Low-Noise BGR** — Provides improved noise performance and power supply rejection ratio.  
4. **Curvature-Compensated BGR** — Includes additional circuitry to minimize second-order temperature effects.

---

#### 🧠 Our Design Choice

In this project, we implement the **Bandgap Reference (BGR)** circuit using a **Self-Biased Current Mirror Architecture**,  
as it provides a good balance between **simplicity**, **power efficiency**, and **temperature stability** for integrated circuit applications.

### 2.3 Self-Biased Current Mirror Based BGR
The **Self-Biased Current Mirror Based Bandgap Reference (BGR)** circuit is composed of several functional sub-blocks that together generate a stable, temperature-independent reference voltage.

---

#### 🧩 Main Components

1. **CTAT Voltage Generation Circuit**  
   Produces a voltage that decreases with increasing temperature.

2. **PTAT Voltage Generation Circuit**  
   Produces a voltage that increases with temperature.

3. **Self-Biased Current Mirror Circuit**  
   Establishes a stable bias current without relying on an external source.

4. **Reference Branch Circuit**  
   Combines the PTAT and CTAT voltages to generate a constant reference voltage.

5. **Start-Up Circuit**  
### 2.3.1 CTAT Voltage Generation Circuit
<img width="222" height="292"  src="https://github.com/pavanimocharla106/BGR_Pavani/blob/main/images/17.jpeg" />

### 2.3.2 PTAT Voltage Generation Circuit
<img width="487" height="488"  src="https://github.com/pavanimocharla106/BGR_Pavani/blob/main/images/16.jpeg" />

### 2.3.3 Self-Biased Current Mirror Circuit

The **Self-Biased Current Mirror** is a special type of current mirror that does **not require any external biasing source**.  
Instead, it **automatically establishes its own bias current** through internal feedback, achieving a stable operating point without relying on an external reference.

#### ⚙️ Working Principle

In a self-biased current mirror, the **bias current** is generated internally by the circuit configuration itself.  
This is typically achieved using **transistor feedback loops**, where one branch sets the reference voltage or current, and the mirror branch replicates it.

The circuit adjusts itself until the **voltages and currents stabilize** at a desired value — a state known as **self-biasing equilibrium**.  
This eliminates the need for an external current reference, making the design **compact, power-efficient, and self-sufficient**.

---
### 2.3.4 Reference Branch Circuit

The **Reference Branch Circuit** is the core part of the Bandgap Reference (BGR) that performs the **addition of CTAT and PTAT voltages** to produce the final **constant reference voltage**.

This branch typically consists of a **mirror transistor** and a **BJT configured as a diode**.  
The mirror transistor ensures that the **same current** flowing through the current mirror branches also flows through the reference branch, maintaining bias symmetry across the circuit.

#### ⚙️ Working Principle

From the **PTAT generation circuit**, we obtain a **PTAT voltage** and a **PTAT current**.  
This PTAT current is mirrored into the reference branch, where it flows through a **resistor** connected in series with the **CTAT diode**.

However, the **slope of the PTAT voltage** is much smaller compared to that of the **CTAT voltage**.  
To balance these effects and achieve temperature independence, the **resistance value is increased** — since the current is constant, a higher resistance increases the voltage drop proportionally.
As a result, the total output voltage across the resistor becomes the **sum of the PTAT and CTAT components**, yielding a **temperature-stable reference voltage**.

<img width="168" height="487" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-31 122920" src="https://github.com/pavanimocharla106/BGR_Pavani/blob/main/images/11.jpeg" />
---

### 2.3.5 Start-up Circuit

The **Start-up Circuit** is an essential part of the Bandgap Reference (BGR) design that ensures the **self-biased current mirror** starts operating correctly from power-up.

#### ⚙️ Function

In self-biased current mirrors, there exists a **degenerative bias point** where the circuit can settle into an **unwanted zero-current state**.  
Without intervention, the mirror could remain in this state indefinitely, preventing the circuit from reaching its intended operating condition.

To avoid this, a **start-up circuit** is introduced.  
This circuit **forces a small initial current** into the self-biased current mirror when it detects that the mirror current is zero.  
This small perturbation shifts the mirror out of the zero-current equilibrium point.

Once the circuit begins to conduct, the **self-biasing mechanism** of the current mirror takes over and automatically stabilizes the current to its desired operating value.

<img width="652" height="548"  src="https://github.com/pavanimocharla106/BGR_Pavani/blob/main/images/14.jpeg" />

### 2.3.6 Complete BGR Circuit

By combining all the previously discussed building blocks, we can construct the **Complete Bandgap Reference (BGR) Circuit**.

---

#### ⚙️ Circuit Composition

The complete BGR circuit integrates the following components:

1. **CTAT Voltage Generation Circuit** — provides a voltage that decreases with temperature using a BJT diode.  
2. **PTAT Voltage Generation Circuit** — produces a voltage that increases with temperature using resistors and matched BJTs.  
3. **Self-Biased Current Mirror Circuit** — establishes and maintains stable current levels without the need for external biasing.  
4. **Reference Branch Circuit** — sums the CTAT and PTAT components to generate the temperature-independent reference voltage.  
5. **Start-up Circuit** — ensures the self-biased current mirror starts correctly by eliminating the zero-current operating point.

---

#### 🧩 Working Principle

- The **CTAT** and **PTAT** voltages are carefully scaled and summed to achieve a **temperature-stable output voltage**.  
- The **current mirror** maintains proper biasing across all branches.  
- The **start-up circuit** guarantees reliable operation from power-up.  

Together, these components form a **fully functional Bandgap Reference circuit**, producing a **constant output voltage (~1.2 V)** that remains stable over variations in **temperature, supply voltage, and load conditions**.

<img width="940" height="612"  src="https://github.com/pavanimocharla106/BGR_Pavani/blob/main/images/13.jpeg" />

#### ✅ Advantages of SBCM BGR

- **Simplest Topology:** The circuit structure is straightforward, making it easy to implement.  
- **Ease of Design:** Requires fewer components and has a simpler biasing mechanism compared to op-amp-based BGRs.  
- **Always Stable:** The self-biasing mechanism ensures a stable operating point once the circuit starts.  

#### ⚠️ Limitations of SBCM BGR

- **Low Power Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR):** More sensitive to supply voltage fluctuations.  
- **Cascode Design Required:** A cascode structure may be added to improve PSRR performance.  
- **Voltage Headroom Issue:** Limited voltage swing can affect proper operation in low-voltage designs.  
- **Requires Start-up Circuit:** Essential to prevent the circuit from remaining in the zero-current state.

## 3.4.1 ⚙️ CTAT Simulation  
### CTAT Voltage Generation with Single BJT Netlist

#### 🧠 Theory  
- A **BJT used as a diode** (by shorting its base and collector) produces a voltage that **decreases linearly with temperature**.  
- When a **constant current source (10 µA)** flows through the BJT, the **base-emitter voltage (V_BE)** shows a **negative temperature coefficient** (typically −2 mV/°C).  
- This negative slope of **V_BE vs. Temperature** represents the **CTAT characteristic**.

#### ⚡ Circuit Setup  
- **Device Used:** `sky130_fd_pr__pnp_05v5_w3p40l3p40`  
- **Bias Current:** 10 µA (constant current source)  
- **Output Measured:** Voltage across BJT (V_BE)   

#### 🧾 Expected Output  
A **straight line with a negative slope** in the **V_BE vs. Temperature** plot:  
> As temperature increases → V_BE decreases → CTAT behavior confirmed ✅  

#### 🖥️ Simulation Command  
Open your terminal and navigate to the **prelayout** directory.  
Run the following command to launch the simulation:

```bash
cd workspaces/vsd-bandgap/bandgap/prelayout/
ngspice ctat_voltage_gen.sp
```

After simulation we can get a wavefrom like below, and from the wavefrom we can see the CTAT behaviour of the BJT, and can find the slope.

<img width="1171" height="761" src="https://github.com/pavanimocharla106/BGR_Pavani/blob/main/images/1.5.jpeg" />

we can see the slope is increasing in case of multiple BJTs.

## 3.4.3 ⚙️ Resistance Temperature Coefficient (Tempco)

### 🧠 Theory  
- A resistor has a **positive temperature coefficient**, meaning its resistance increases as temperature increases.  
- When a constant current (10 µA) flows through the resistor, the voltage across it is given by:

  V_R = I × R(T)

  where R(T) is the resistance that changes with temperature.  
- As temperature rises, R(T) increases, so the voltage V_R also increases.  
- Therefore, the voltage across the resistor behaves as a **PTAT voltage**.  
- In a Bandgap Reference (BGR) circuit, this PTAT voltage adds to the thermal voltage from the BJT to cancel the CTAT behavior.

### 🖥️ Simulation Command
```spice 
cd workspaces/vsd-bandgap/bandgap/prelayout/
ngspice res_tempco.sp
```
Also we can find the PTAT voltages across the resistance for different current values from the following curve.

### 3.4.4 BGR using Ideal OpAmp

Now after simulating all our components, let's quick check our BGR behaviour using one **VCVS** as an **ideal OpAmp**.

In this simulation, we should get the reference voltage as an **umbrella-shaped curve** and it should be approximately **1.2V**.

### 3.4.5 BGR with selfbias current mirror
Now we will replace the ideal Op-Amp with self-biased current mirror which is our proposed design. We expect same type of output as in case of ideal OpAmp based BGR. We will also check for different corners, and will see how our circuit is performing in different corners.

## 4. Layout Design

Now after getting our final **netlist**, we have to design the **layout** for our **Bandgap Reference (BGR)** circuit.  
Layout is the graphical representation of the physical masks used in **IC fabrication**.  
We are going to use the **Magic VLSI tool** for our layout design.

---

### 4.1 Getting Started with Magic

**Magic** is an open-source **VLSI layout editor** used to design, edit, and verify integrated circuit layouts.

#### 🧭 To launch Magic, open your terminal and run the following command:

<img width="947" height="387" src="https://github.com/pavanimocharla106/BGR_Pavani/blob/main/images/37.jpeg" />

Now it will open up two windows, those are tkcon.tcl and toplevel. Now let's discuss some basic magic tool operations.
```bash
g : grid on/off
z : zoom in
Shift + z : zoom out

Draw a box : 
  1. Left click + Right click of the mouse : pointer will be at a grid point
  2. Right click : a blank box will be created from the pointed point to the point where right click occured
 
Fill a box with a layer:
  1. Draw a box
  2. Select a layer from the tool manager
  3. Middle click the mouse button
  
  or 
  
  1. Draw a box
  2. Write "paint <layer name>" in the tkcon.tcl window


Delete a layer:
  1. Draw a box where you want to delete a layer
  2. Write "erase <layer name>" in the tkcon.tcl window
 
Delete an area:
  1. Draw a box where you want to delete an area
  2. Press 'a'
  3. Press 'd'

u : undo
r : rotate
m : move
c : copy
```
Now device wise we have the following devices in our circuit.

PFETS
NFETS
Resistor Bank
BJTs
Now in order to design faster we should follow the hierarchical design manner. i.e we will design one cell then we will instance that to another level and do placement and routing.

In our design we have 3 hierarchies. Those are

Hierarchy-1 (Basic Cells) : NFET, PFET, BJT, Resistor
Hierarchy-2 (Blocks of similar cells): NFETS, PFETS, PNP10, RESBANK, STARTERNFET
Hierarchy-3 (Top Level): TOP

## 4.2 Blocks Design

### 4.2.1 Design of NFETs

We have designed the **NFET layout** by placing all the transistors in a single well-defined region to ensure proper matching and compactness.  
The layout is carefully optimized to maintain **symmetry**, **matching accuracy**, and **noise immunity**.

#### ⚙️ Design Details:
1. **Common Centroid Matching:**  
   - All NFETs are placed following the **common centroid** technique to minimize mismatch due to process gradients.  
   - This helps in achieving balanced electrical characteristics across devices.

2. **Dummy Devices:**  
   - **Dummy transistors** are added at the edges of the active device array.  
   - These prevent **diffusion edge effects** and ensure that active devices experience uniform process conditions.

3. **Guard Ring:**  
   - A **p+ guard ring** is added around the NFET array to protect the layout from substrate noise and improve device isolation.  
   - It also helps in reducing latch-up susceptibility.

4. **Diffusion Continuity:**  
   - The layout ensures **no diffusion breaks**, which helps maintain low series resistance and better current matching.

5. **Layout Orientation:**  
   - All gates are oriented in the **same direction** for consistent channel stress.  
   - Source and drain regions are shared between adjacent devices to reduce area and parasitics.

``` bash
cd ➜ /workspaces/vsd-bandgap/bandgap/layout (main) $ magic -T sky130A.tech  nfets.mag
```
<img width="1217" height="740"  src="https://github.com/pavanimocharla106/BGR_Pavani/blob/main/images/30.jpeg" />

### 4.2.2 Design of PFETs

We have designed the **PFET layout block** by grouping all PFETs together in a symmetric and well-matched arrangement.  
The layout emphasizes **device matching**, **isolation**, and **robustness against noise** to ensure accurate current mirroring and stable biasing.

#### ⚙️ Design Details:
1. **Matching Arrangement:**  
   - All PFETs are placed in a **symmetrical array** using a **common centroid pattern** to reduce gradient-induced mismatches.  
   - Ensures that variations in oxide thickness or dopant concentration are evenly distributed across all devices.

2. **Dummy Transistors:**  
   - **Dummy PFETs** are added at the edges of the active device array.  
   - These dummies improve **process uniformity** and minimize edge effects in the active transistors.

3. **Guard Ring Implementation:**  
   - A **n+ guard ring** is placed around the PFET block to protect it from substrate noise and potential coupling from nearby circuits.  
   - It provides better **isolation** and enhances overall layout reliability.

4. **Shared Source/Drain Regions:**  
   - Adjacent transistors share common diffusion areas to minimize parasitic resistance and save layout area.

5. **Orientation Consistency:**  
   - All gates are aligned in the same direction for uniform channel characteristics and ease of routing.

### 4.2.3 Design of RESBANK
<img width="1182" height="752" src="https://github.com/pavanimocharla106/BGR_Pavani/blob/main/images/32.jpeg" />

### 4.2.4 Design of PNP10
We have created the layout by putting all the PNPs together, with appropriate matching, and used dummies to enhance noise performance.
<img width="1196" height="690"  src="https://github.com/pavanimocharla106/BGR_Pavani/blob/main/images/31.jpeg" />

### 4.2.5 Design of STARTERNFET
We placed the the two w=1, l=7 NFETs together with a guardring to desingn the STATRTERNFET.
<img width="962" height="315"  src="https://github.com/pavanimocharla106/BGR_Pavani/blob/main/images/34.jpeg" />

### 4.4 TOP LEVEL DESIGN
The **top-level layout** integrates all the sub-blocks of the Bandgap Reference (BGR) circuit — including NFETs, PFETs, resistor bank, BJT, and the startup circuit — into a single unified layout using **Magic VLSI**.

#### 🧩 Layout Overview:
The layout is organized for optimal matching, symmetry, and noise immunity. Each functional block is carefully placed to minimize parasitic effects and ensure consistent temperature behavior.

#### ⚙️ Key Components:
1. **NFET Block (Bottom Section):**
   - Contains all NMOS transistors arranged in a **common centroid** configuration.
   - Includes dummy devices and a guard ring for isolation and matching.
   - Used primarily in the current mirror and startup circuit.

2. **PFET Block (Middle Section):**
   - PFETs are placed symmetrically to ensure equal current distribution.
   - Guard ring provided to suppress substrate coupling noise.
   - Used in the mirror and biasing circuits.

3. **Resistor Bank (Top Section):**
   - Houses all resistors in a matched array configuration.
   - Edge dummies used to avoid process variations.
   - Provides PTAT and CTAT voltage scaling.

4. **BJT Block:**
   - Diode-connected BJT for CTAT voltage generation.
   - Placed close to the resistor bank to ensure uniform temperature tracking.

5. **Startup Circuit (Center):**
   - Labeled as **starternfet** in the layout.
   - Ensures proper startup of the self-biased current mirror.
   - Connected to NFET region for bias initialization.

6. **Guard Rings and Isolation:**
   - Full perimeter **p+ guard ring** implemented for substrate noise isolation.
   - Ensures reliable and low-noise reference operation.
